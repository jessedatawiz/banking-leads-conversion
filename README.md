# Loan Prediction Application

This project aims to develop a machine learning-powered application that predicts loan eligibility. By leveraging the power of Google Cloud Platform (GCP), we will build, train, and deploy a robust model that can assess loan applications.

## Project Intentions

* **Build a machine learning model:**  Utilize the "Banking | Marketing | Leads Conversion Data" dataset from Kaggle to train a model that effectively predicts loan eligibility.
* **Leverage GCP services:** Employ Vertex AI for efficient model training and hyperparameter tuning, and Cloud Run for scalable and cost-effective deployment.
* **Focus on user experience:** Collaborate with a UX/UI designer to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the application.
* **Demonstrate practical application:** Showcase the model's utility through a simple web application that allows users to input loan application details and receive a prediction.
  
## Future Goals

* **Enhance the model:** Explore more advanced machine learning techniques and feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy.
* **Expand the application:** Add more features to the application, such as personalized loan recommendations and financial planning tools.
* **Integrate with other systems:**  Potentially integrate the application with existing banking systems for seamless loan processing.

This project is a work in progress. Stay tuned for updates and further development!
